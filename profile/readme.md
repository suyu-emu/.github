# The suyu Emulator

[![Android Building](https://github.com/suyu-emu/SuyuEclipse/actions/workflows/android-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/suyu-emu/SuyuEclipse/actions/workflows/android-build.yml) [![Codespell](https://github.com/suyu-emu/SuyuEclipse/actions/workflows/codespell.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/suyu-emu/SuyuEclipse/actions/workflows/codespell.yml)

This repository is a mirror of the [**suyu**](https://web.archive.org/web/20240925000822/https://git.suyu.dev/suyu) organization, as a way to continue the project after the self-hosted websites shut down in 2026.

**Notes**: We do not support or condone piracy in any form. In order to use suyu, you'll need keys from your real Switch system, and games which you have legally obtained and paid for. We do not intend to make money or profit from this project.

We're in need of developers. Please join go to this Org's Github Discussions Page or DM a developer if you want to contribute as the project repository is private, although we will make a mirror on another platform so users have access to the source code, as is required under the GPL 3.0 License. 

This repo is currently based on Yuzu EA 4176 (with multiple commits borrowed from the Sudachi, Torzu, Ziunx, Citron/Uzuy and Nozomi forks) but the code will be "evolved" from the ground up to combat legal and performance related concerns.

Our only websites are suyu.dev and suyu-emu.github.io so please be cautious when using other sites offering downloads for builds relating to suyu and other emulators.

<h4 align="center"><b>suyu</b> was the most well known continuation of the world's most popular, open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, yuzu, but is now something more.
<br>
It is written in C++ with portability in mind, and we provide builds for Windows, Linux, Android and our own operating system: SuyuOS. MacOS is in development and iOS is being considered.
